## 📖 Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes onset using supervised learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment aspects of the project.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about several health indicators such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, etc., collected from patients. It is crucial for predicting the likelihood of diabetes onset.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed dataset for machine learning model compatibility.
- **Model Development:** Trained multiple machine learning models to predict diabetes onset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Deployment:** Implemented a simple Flask web application for demonstrating model predictions (if applicable).

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

Several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network (if applicable)

Each model's performance was compared based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Precision:** Proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Proportion of true positives identified correctly.
- **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
